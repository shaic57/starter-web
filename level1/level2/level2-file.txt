Version Control
See what files have changes in the file browser view, what lines have changes in the editor view, bring up a diff of the current fileâ€™s changes, commit a subset, TextMate supports it all for all the major version control systems.

Scoped Settings
One file mixing languages? Projects using different build systems? Third party code with different formatting preferences? TextMate can handle it all by associating detailed scope selectors with key shortcuts, settings, etc.

Commands
The UNIX underpinnings of macOS allows custom actions to be written in any language that can work with stdin, stdout, and environment variables, and for complex interactions TextMate expose both WebKit and a dialog framework for Mac-native or HTML-based interfaces.

Snippets
Commonly used pieces of text or code can be turned into snippets with placeholders, transformations, and more, to have them adapt according to the context in which they are used.
